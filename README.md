  - `carpet_type`, a string representing the type of carpeting
  - `options`, a list of strings, representing 0 or more options 
  - `promo_code`, a string representing the discount code
- The function must print the price of the order in dollars (i.e., with two decimal places). Refer to the example output for the specific formatting.
